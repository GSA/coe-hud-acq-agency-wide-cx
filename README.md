## Background

The mission of the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE), housed within the [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov) (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/) (HUD), the Customer Experience (CX) CoE was tasked with assisting HUD with the development of recommendations for the implementation of an optimal customer experience strategy. Implementation of this strategy is to include utilization of the latest technology (artificial intelligence, learning systems, and robotic process automation) as well as a cohesive customer experience across all channels, including contact centers, online platforms, informational materials, and in-person interactions.

## Purpose

HUD has a need to build a centralized Customer Experience Capability, in the form of an Office of Customer Experience (OCX) under the Chief Operating Officer (COO) in order to provide agency-wide coordination and analysis of customer and client interactions.

This must be achieved in such a way that an ‘advisory board’ will be established in order to align leadership across HUD’s program areas on focus areas for the OCX's work, and ‘project teams’ assembled to support OCX efforts in designing, prototyping, piloting, and guiding the implementation of Agency-wide solutions that measurably improve the Customer Experience (CX) HUD delivers to all of its customers. Additionally, it must permit HUD's OCX to define Customer Experience (CX) metrics enterprise-wide andmeet [OMB A-11 compliance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf) requirements.
