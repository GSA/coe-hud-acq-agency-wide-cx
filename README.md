## Background

The mission of the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA), [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS), [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE) is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization across government to improve the public experience, improve outcomes, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. The CoEs accomplish this by centralizing top Government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset to collaborate across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the U.S. [Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/) (HUD), the Customer Experience (CX) CoE was tasked with assisting HUD with the development of recommendations for the implementation of an optimal customer experience strategy. Implementation of this strategy is to include utilization of the latest technology (artificial intelligence, learning systems, and robotic process automation) as well as a cohesive customer experience across all channels, including contact centers, online platforms, informational materials, and in-person interactions.

## Purpose

HUD has a need to build a centralized Customer Experience Capability, in the form of an Office of Customer Experience (OCX) under the Chief Operating Officer (COO) in order to provide agency-wide coordination and analysis of customer and client interactions that accelerate the delivery of meaningful improvements to customer experience. The OCX team will collaborate with HUD leadership, stakeholders, and the Advisory Board to establish the OCX, further elaborate the operational models, drive forward CX initiatives, support and participate in CX working groups, and define enterprise-wide Customer Experience (CX) metrics that meet [OMB A-11 compliance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf) requirements.
